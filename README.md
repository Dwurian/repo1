# Read Me

Sorry that the file name may seem a bit aggressive. If it scared you, I offer my sincerest apologies. This is a file in which I try to use the various functionalities of the markdown language according to [this cheetsheet here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Such functionalities include: 

1. Numbered lists
2. I'm still trying out the numbered lists so bear with me
3. There we go! The rule of three applies 
   3.1. Oh look
      3.1.1. A sub list
   2. How fun!

Or we can do: 

* Bullet points
   * Sub-bullet points! 
      * Is that a word?
* Nice!  

Now let's try

(a) The other three statements are all false \
(b) Only one of all four options are true \
(c) This statement is true \
(d) Statement (b) is false 

I actually haven't thought the game above through so there might not be an answer. Why bother! Logic is overrated anyways. Who needs logic when I can just **bolden** or *italicize* or even ***bolden and italicize*** my text as I wish! Look at me and how random I am! As I always say: 

> Banana Bread is good. 

See! This is fun! And I can do a table as well:

|This|is|a *table*|
|-:|:-:|:-|
|You can|eat dinner|on it|
|I'm **kidding**!|Please don't eat dinner|on your computer screen|
|You're computer|won't be|happy|
|Did I just|use "you're"|insted of "your"?|
|Sorry|I meant to use "your"|:)|

Of course I need to include some code: 

`print("hello world")`
    
That one is a classic. Equations also work very well: 

e<sup>i&pi;</sup> + 1 = 0 

Or embed an svg? 

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?e^{i\pi}&plus;1=0 "Yay!")

I like that font better. Speaking of embedding, here's a funny picture.

Don't you love it? And finally, here's a picture that links to a video of red pandas to finish this file off. Cheers!
